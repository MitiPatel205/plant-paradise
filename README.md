## ❓ FAQ

- **How often should I water my plants?**  
  Most houseplants prefer their soil to dry out between waterings. Check the top inch of soil; if it's dry, it's time to water!
- **What is the best spot for my indoor plants?**  
  Most indoor plants love bright, indirect sunlight. Avoid direct afternoon sun unless your plant is a sun-lover like succulents.
- **Are your plants pet-friendly?**  
  Yes! We have a special selection of pet-safe plants.
